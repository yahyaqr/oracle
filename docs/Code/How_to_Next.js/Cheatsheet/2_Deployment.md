## Vercel

1. Commit any pending changes to the repo and link it on Github.
2. Create a free account at https://vercel.com/
3. Create a new project https://vercel.com/new
4. Import this github repository (give Github access to Vercel when asked).
5. Skip creating a team (it's a paid feature) if asked.

6. Click **Deploy**. Vercel will give you a custom public URL (ending with `.vercel.app`) for your site. You can later replace it with your own domain.

### Deploy to Preview and Production

- Push to any branch other than `main` on Github and Vercel will deploy to a custom public URL (unique for every deployment). Useful for testing purpose before making it live on production domain.
- Push to `main` branch on Github and vercel will deploy to production domain.

### Link custom domain

[Detailed guide by Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains)

1. Go to your domain registrar website (Godaddy, Namecheap, etc) and change nameserver to:

```
ns1.vercel-dns.com
ns2.vercel-dns.com
```

2. Now go to https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains and add that custom domain.

### Create development url like dev.yoursite.com

Creating different environments for development and production is a neat way to do development while maintaining a bug-free production server. All the changes you do on a `dev` branch will be deployed to `dev.yoursite.com` and won't affect your prod site `yoursite.com`. Let's set this up:

1. Create git dev branch: `git checkout -b dev`
   - Commit something (at least one new commit is required for Vercel to deploy this branch)
   - Push branch to github: `git push --set-upstream origin dev`
2. In Vercel, go to project domain: https://vercel.com/{username}/{project}/settings/domains.

   - Add domain: dev.yoursite.com
   - Add Git branch: `dev` and save.![](https://gourav.io/blog/nextjs-cheatsheet/Untitled---1752574285.png)

3. Visit your dev site `dev.yoursite.com`

4. Any commits made to `dev` branch will now show in `dev.yoursite.com` along with unique url generated by Vercel for that deployment.

Later, when everything seems okay you can merge code from `dev` -> `main` branch to reflect changes on prod server.

You can create even more branches like testing, staging, etc.
