## Review a PR

1. In the PR you're reviewing, select the **Files changed** tab.
    
    ![Screenshot of tabs on the GitHub pull request page. The tab titled Files Changed is highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/content/media/how-to-review-pull-request/pr-menu.png)
    
2. Compare the original document to the edited one. The original document will be in red, and the proposed document will be in green. Any added text will be highlighted in the green (new) section, and any deleted text will be highlighted in the red (original) section.

3. Add comments or suggest changes by selecting the plus (+) icon to the left of the line you'd like to comment on. To select multiple lines, select and drag the plus sign.

    You can only add comments or suggestions to lines that have been edited in the current PR. To make other changes, [edit that file in your own PR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/content/how-to-write-quick-edits).
    
4. A box will open. Enter your comments or questions there. If you'd like, you can use the buttons in the toolbar to format your text, add bulleted and numbered lists, or insert code blocks and images.

5. You can also suggest a change to the text in that line.
    
    1. In the toolbar for the comment, select the **+-** icon (probably the icon furthest to the left). This is the **Insert a suggestion** button.
        
        ![Screenshot of tabs in a comment box on the GitHub Files Changed page. The tab with a + and - icon is highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/content/media/how-to-review-pull-request/insert-suggestion.png)
        
    2. The text from the line you selected will be included in a code block (inside two sets of ``` backticks).
        
        ![Screenshot of a comment box on the GitHub Files Changed page. An example of how to write the syntax for a suggestion is displayed.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/content/media/how-to-review-pull-request/suggestion-text.png)
        
        To suggest changes to text that includes a triple-ticked code fence (```), replace the outer/enclosing `suggestion` backticks with tildes (`~~~`).
        
    3. Edit the text. Use the buttons in the comment box for simple formatting like bold, italics, and bullets, or use the [Markdown syntax elements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/content/markdown-reference) directly. You can also add comments to this box below the code-block section.
        
6. After you've made your comment, select **Start a review**. The PR author will be notified of your changes. If you used the **Insert a suggestion** button in the previous step, the author will be able to commit your suggestion directly to the document.
    
    If you want to bring someone else into the conversation, you can **@mention** other contributors by their GitHub alias in your comments. Mentioned GitHub users will receive an email containing your comment. You can also use Markdown in your comments, and your comment's Markdown is rendered once you submit the comment.
    
7. In the **Conversations** tab, read through the comments. If you have questions or comments, add them to the conversation. You can also add reactions to comments by selecting the smiley face icon in the bottom-left corner of each comment.
