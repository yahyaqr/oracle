**Address and resolve all comments before merging.** This way, you won’t leave anyone guessing what was implemented and what wasn’t.

And by addressing, I don’t mean that you have to implement every single comment, but at least leave a reply or react with an emoji to indicate that it was handled or won’t be handled.

Then the reviewer can resolve the conversation. GitHub even has a setting you can enable that blocks merging unless all conversations have been resolved.
