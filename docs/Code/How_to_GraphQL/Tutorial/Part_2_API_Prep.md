In this series you are learning how to implement end-to-end type safety using React, GraphQL, Prisma, and some other helpful tools that tie those three together.

![hero image prisma](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/p2zxqf70/production/838c88ca3817165045cc051d8845880e5a313baf-844x474.svg)

## Create a TypeScript project

To kick things off, create a new folder in your working directory that will contain your GraphQL server's code wherever you would like:

```sh
mkdir graphql-server # Example folder
```

This project will useÂ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), a package manager for Node.js, to manage and install new packages. Navigate into your new folder and initialize npm using the following commands:

```sh
cd graphql-servernpm init -y
```

### Install the basic packages

While building this API, you will install various packages that will help in the development of your application. For now, install the following development packages:

- `ts-node-dev`: Allows you to execute TypeScript code with live-reload on file changes
- `typescript`: The TypeScript package that allows you to provide typings to your JavaScript applications
- `@types/node`: TypeScript type definitions for Node.js

```sh
npm i -D ts-node-dev typescript @types/node
```

> **Note**: These dependencies were installed as development dependencies because they are only needed during development. None of them are part of the production deployment.

### Set up TypeScript

With TypeScript installed in your project, you can now initialize the TypeScript configuration file using theÂ `tsc`Â command-line interface toolÂ _(CLI)_:

```sh
npx tsc --init
```

The above command will create a new file namedÂ `tsconfig.json`Â at the root of your project and comes with a default set of configurations for how to compile and handle your TypeScript code. For the purposes of this series, you will leave the default settings.

Create a new folder namedÂ `src`Â and within that folder a new file namedÂ `index.ts`:

```sh
mkdir srctouch src/index.ts
```

This will be the entry point to your TypeScript code. Within that file, add a simpleÂ `console.log`:

```ts
// src/index.ts
console.log('Hey there! ðŸ‘‹');
```

### Add a development script

In order to run your code, you will useÂ `ts-node-dev`, which will compile and run your TypeScript code and watch for file changes. When a file is changed in your application, it will re-compile and re-run your code.

WithinÂ `package.json`, in theÂ `"scripts"`Â section, add a new script namedÂ `"dev"`Â that usesÂ `ts-node-dev`Â to run your entry file:

```json
// package.json

// ...
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "dev": "ts-node-dev src/index.ts"
},
// ...
```

You can now use the following command to run your code:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Set up the database

The next piece you will set up is the database. You will be using a PostgreSQL database for this application. There are many different ways to host and work with a PostgreSQL database, however, one of the simplest ways is to deploy your database usingÂ [Railway](https://railway.app/).

Head over toÂ [https://railway.app](https://railway.app/)Â and, if you don't already have one, create an account.

After creating an account and logging in, you should see a page like this:

![](https://www.prisma.io/blog/posts/e2e-type-safety-2/railway-home.png)

Hit theÂ **New Project**Â button, or simply click theÂ **Create a New Project**Â area.

You will be presented with a search box and a few common options. Select theÂ **Provision PostgreSQL**Â option.

![](https://www.prisma.io/blog/posts/e2e-type-safety-2/railway-postgres-option.png)

The option selected above creates a new PostgreSQL database and deploys it. Once the server is ready, you should see your provisioned database on the screen. Click theÂ **PostgreSQL**Â instance.

![](https://www.prisma.io/blog/posts/e2e-type-safety-2/railway-new-db.png)

That will open up a menu with a few different tabs. On theÂ **Connect**Â tab, you will find your database's connection string. Take note of where to find this string as you will need them in just a little while.

![](https://www.prisma.io/blog/posts/e2e-type-safety-2/railway-connect.png)

## Set up Prisma

Next you will set up Prisma. Your GraphQL server will use Prisma Client to query your PostgreSQL database.

To set up Prisma, you first need to install Prisma CLI as a development dependency:

```sh
npm i -D prisma
```

### Initialize Prisma

With Prisma CLI installed, you will have access to a set of useful tools and commands provided by Prisma. The command you will use here is calledÂ `init`, and will initialize Prisma in your project:

```sh
npx prisma init
```

This command will create a newÂ `prisma`Â folder within your project. Inside this folder you will find a file,Â `schema.prisma`, which contains the start of a Prisma schema.

That file uses the Prisma Schema LanguageÂ _(PSL)_Â and is where you will define your database's tables and fields. It currently looks as follows:

```go
// prisma/schema.prisma

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Within theÂ `datasource`Â block, note theÂ `url`Â field. This fields equals a valueÂ `env("DATABASE_URL")`. This value tells Prisma to look within the environment variables for a variable namedÂ `DATABASE_URL`Â to find the database's connection string.

### Set the environment variable

`prisma init`Â also created aÂ `.env`Â file for you with a single variable namedÂ `DATABASE_URL`. This variable holds the connection string Prisma will use to connect to your database.

Replace the current default contents of that variable with the connection string you retrieved via the Railway UI:

```env
# .env

# Example: postgresql://postgres:Pb98NuLZM22ptNuR4Erq@containers-us-west-63.railway.app:6049/railway

DATABASE_URL="<your-connection-string>"
```

### Model your data

The application you are building will need two different database tables:Â `User`Â andÂ `Message`. Each "user" will be able to have many associated "messages".

> **Note**: Think back to the previous article, where you set up manually written types that define the user and message models.

Begin by modeling theÂ `User`Â table. This table will need the following columns:

- `id`: The unique ID of the database record
- `name`: The name of the user
- `createdAt`: A timestamp of when each user was created

Add the followingÂ [`model`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model)Â block to your Prisma schema:

```go
// prisma/schema.prisma

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Next, add aÂ `Message`Â model with the following fields:

- `id`: The unique ID of the database record
- `body`: The contents of the message
- `createdAt`: A timestamp of when each message was created

```go
// prisma/schema.prisma

model Message {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  body   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Finally, set up a one-to-many relation between theÂ `User`Â andÂ `Message`Â tables.

```go
// prisma/schema.prisma

model User {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  messages  Message[]
}

model Message {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  body   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  userId    Int
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

This data modeling step is an important one. What you have done here is set up theÂ _source of truth_Â for the shape of your data. You database's schema is now defined in one central place, and used to generate a type-safe API that interacts with that database.

> **Note**: Think of the Prisma Schema as the glue between the shape of your database and the API that interacts with it.

### Perform the first migration

Your database schema is now modeled and you are ready to apply this schema to your database. You will use Prisma Migrate to manage your database migrations.

Run the following command to create and apply a migration to your database:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

The above command will create a new migration file namedÂ `init`, apply that migration to your database, and finally generate Prisma Client based off of that schema.

If you head back over to the Railway UI, in theÂ **Data**Â tab you should see your tables listed. If so, the migration worked and your database is ready to be put to work!

![](https://www.prisma.io/blog/posts/e2e-type-safety-2/railway-tables.png)

### Seed the database ðŸŒ±

That last thing to do before beginning to build out your GraphQL API is seed the database with some initial data for you to interact with.

Within theÂ `prisma`Â folder, create a new file namedÂ `seed.ts`:

```sh
touch prisma/seed.ts
```

Paste the following contents into that file:

```ts
// prisma/seed.ts

import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  // Delete all `User` and `Message` records
  await prisma.message.deleteMany({});
  await prisma.user.deleteMany({});
  // (Re-)Create dummy `User` and `Message` records
  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: "Jack",
      messages: {
        create: [
          {
            body: "A Note for Jack",
          },
          {
            body: "Another note for Jack",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  });
  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: "Ryan",
      messages: {
        create: [
          {
            body: "A Note for Ryan",
          },
          {
            body: "Another note for Ryan",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  });
  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: "Adam",
      messages: {
        create: [
          {
            body: "A Note for Adam",
          },
          {
            body: "Another note for Adam",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  });
}

main().then(() => {
  console.log("Data seeded...");
});
```

This script clears out the database and then creates three users. Each user is given two messages associated with it.

> **Note**: In the next article, you will dive deeper into the process writing a few queries using Prisma Client.

Now that the seed script is available, head over to yourÂ `package.json`Â file and add the following key to the JSON object:

```json
// package.json

// ...
"prisma": {
  "seed": "ts-node-dev prisma/seed.ts"
},
// ...
```

Use the following command to run your seed script:

```sh
npx prisma db seed
```

After running the script, if you head back to the Railway UI and into theÂ **Data**Â tab, you should be able to navigate through the newly added data.
