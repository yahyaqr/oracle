# What are your own danger signs during a disagreement?
My own danger sign was when I abruptly fall silent. It signals the depletion of my mental energy, hindering my ability to handle any situation properly. I believe that's the moment when my mind begins to form biased judgments.

Even though I understand that expressing the issue is the right thing to do, sometimes I'm just too tired. Communication takes a lot of time and energy. So, I've learned to put things on hold and talk when I'm feeling more refreshed and mentally sharp.
