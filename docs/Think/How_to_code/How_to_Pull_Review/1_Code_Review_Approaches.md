I have encountered different approaches to code review, depending on the pull request, reviewer preference, time available, etc.

1. **Review per commit:** This can only be done if the commit history is available and if it is clear enough.
2. **Review per file:** This is easier to do if the pull request isn’t very big.
3. **Check out the code locally:** This approach consumes the most time and effort, but it’s sometimes the only way to actually understand what’s going on.
