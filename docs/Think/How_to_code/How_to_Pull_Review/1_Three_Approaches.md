## Code review approaches

I have encountered different approaches to code review, depending on the pull request, reviewer preference, time available, etc.

1. **Review per commit:** This can only be done if the commit history is available and if it is clear enough.
2. **Review per file:** This is easier to do if the pull request isn’t very big.
3. **Check out the code locally:** This approach consumes the most time and effort, but it’s sometimes the only way to actually understand what’s going on.

## Empathy as the guideline

Code review is a purely human communication process. And a good way to approach humans (especially the ones you need to work with) is with empathy. This includes the obvious: politeness, kindness, and respect. But you can go a step further and remember that when you’re assigning reviewers to look through your code, you’re requesting another person’s time and energy. Therefore, it’s nice to make the process easier for them, and doing so will probably result in a more efficient code review. So, keeping empathy in mind, let’s discuss some practical tips that can make your code reviewers happier.
