### Do I have value?
Yes, every individual, regardless of their physical or mental capabilities, age, or stage of life, inherently possesses value. Your inherent value (IV) is comprised of two fundamental components: effort (E) and time (∆T). Effort represents the sheer amount of work and energy you invest in various endeavors. Time, on the other hand, encompasses the finite resource of moments of your life.

In economics, the concept of value often emerges from scarcity. When a resource is scarce—meaning that its availability is limited relative to the demand for it—people assign value to it because it becomes desirable and sought after. That's why your effort and time can be considered as valuable.

Inherent value can be expressed as IV = E / ∆T.

This equation expresses inherent value as the ratio of effort (E) to the change in time (ΔT). Essentially, it states that the amount of value you bring is determined by the amount of effort you exert divided by how quickly you can accomplish it.

You can enhance your value either by increasing the amount of work and energy you invest or by reducing the time required to complete a task. In many cases, particularly as an individual contributor in the workplace, your value is often measured by the quantity of time you dedicate to your work. You can achieve a multiplier effect or double your value by improving your work processes, either through standardized procedures, automating repetitive tasks, utilizing technology, and investing in knowledge and skill development.
### But why is inherent value often irrelevant to the perceived values?
So, you may find an excellent person being valued less than what he brings to the table. The significance of a person's inherent values, which we would call impact (I), comes from how they can offer their value to the right problem. That's where value proposition (VP) comes in.

The formula for a value proposition can be expressed as VP = IV * I.

In other words, inherent value with no impact yields no value proposition, and therefore, no perceived value. In order to create a compelling value proposition, it is essential to not only have inherent value but also to deliver meaningful impact that resonates with the needs and desires of the target audience.
### How to translate value into tangible impact?
As stated before, impact are the result of addressing the right problem (P) with the right value proposition.

Thus, the formula for impact takes the form of I = P * VP.

If you've found a significant problem without being able to bring a good value proposition, then you come home with nothing. That also goes the other way; if you have a great value proposition but are unable to find any applicable use cases, you won't be generating impact.

Interestingly, if you substitute between the formula of inherent value, impact, and value proposition, you would find that problem is time divided by effort.

IV = E / ∆T
VP = IV * I
I = P * VP

~~VP~~ = IV * P * ~~VP~~
1 = IV * P

That's make a problem is P = 1 / IV and P = ∆T / E.

A problem occurs when our desired outcomes don't align with what we're capable of achieving. We already talked about how scarcity imposes value. I am pleased to tell you that scarcity is the very definition of a problem: a mismatch between what we want and what we have the means to achieve.

Think of it like two sides of a coin: on one side, there's what's valuable or important to us, but on the flip side, there are the challenges or issues we encounter.

When it comes to effort and time, a problem is proportional to time and inversed proportional to effort. It means that the longer it takes to solve a problem, the bigger the problem is and also the less effort we invest to it, the bigger it appears.
