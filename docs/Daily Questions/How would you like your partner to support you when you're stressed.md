The feature I value the most and found in her is her well-organized archetype. I am a free creative soul, often chaotic, and I am aware of my need for day-to-day stability. When I observe her, I am convinced that her influence can help me absorb these traits.

Being close to her is what I need; it's like experiencing two chemical elements combining into a noble element.
