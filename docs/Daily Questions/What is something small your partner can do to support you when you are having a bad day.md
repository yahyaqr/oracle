She could send her portrait photos; I'd really appreciate that. She could also say some affirmation sentences; it may ease my clouded mind.

When we're officially married, I would love caring gestures like having served a cup of hot chocolate, fruit slices, a warm blanket, or maybe a bowl of warm soup. I think it's not about the things; it's more about the caring gesture.

I don't think cuddling or intimate touch will help. I need to clear my cloudy mind before I can focus on or enjoy other activities.
